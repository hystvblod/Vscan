# VScanPro

VScanPro is a minimal web scanner and PDF tool. It runs entirely in the browser so nothing needs to be installed.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser or serve it locally and visit the page. For example:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
   then open `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

The app offers basic scanning features, document history and light/dark mode. You can switch languages using the dropdown in the header. After adding a signature, drag it to move and pinch on touch screens to resize it.

## Premium extras

Some options are marked as **Premium** inside the interface (watermarking, advanced signatures, passwordâ€‘protected PDFs, etc.). Click the star button in the header to simulate enabling these features and to remove advertising banners.

## Languages

Interface translations are available for:

- French
- English
- German
- Italian
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- Portuguese (Brazil)

The language switcher stores your choice in local storage so it is restored on the next visit.
